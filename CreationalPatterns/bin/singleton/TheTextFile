Dimensional Mapping Robot
While the device is running, sensors gather ultrasonic data 
by emitting pulses and listening for echoes.
The data is gathered by the Arduino, which converts the data 
the analog data into digital data and then sends it to an application
wich will make a map using that data. The design patterns are impossible to 
apply on the robot code itself due to the limited memory, so the design patterns
will be applied on the secondary application which builds a map 
using the gathered data.


Pattern purpose:
As we only need 1 map we make sure only 1 map is created.
Static implementation.

Pros:
class has only a single instance
global access point to that instance

Cons:

each instance of class is created always, whether it is required or not.
time is wasted in creation of instance if it is not required
might have problems with multithreading
